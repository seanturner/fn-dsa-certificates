--- abstract

Digital signatures are used within X.509 certificates and Certificate
Revocation Lists (CRLs), and to sign messages. This document specifies
the conventions for using, the forthcoming, FIPS 206, the Fast-Fourier
Transform over NTRU-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (FN-DSA),
in Internet X.509 certificates and CRLs.  The conventions for the
associated signatures, subject public keys, and private key are also
described.

# Introduction

The Fast-Fourier Transform over NTRU-Lattice-Based Digital Signature
Algorithm (FN-DSA) is a quantum-resistant digital signature scheme
standardized by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
PQC project {{NIST-PQC}} in, the forthcoming, {{FIPS206}}. This document
specifies the use of the FN-DSA in Public Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX)
certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) at two security
levels: FN-DSA-512 and FN-DSA-1024.

Prior to standardization, FN-DSA was known as Falcon.  FN-DSA and
Falcon are not compatible.

{{FIPS206}} defines two variants of FL-DSA: pure and pre-hash. Only
the former is specified in this document. See {{opcons}} for the
rationale. The pure variant of FN-DSA supports the typical pre-hash
flow.

## Requirements Language

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}


# Identifiers {#oids}

The `AlgorithmIdentifier` type is defined in {{!RFC5912}} as follows:

~~~
    AlgorithmIdentifier{ALGORITHM-TYPE, ALGORITHM-TYPE:AlgorithmSet} ::=
      SEQUENCE {
        algorithm   ALGORITHM-TYPE.&id({AlgorithmSet}),
        parameters  ALGORITHM-TYPE.
                      &Params({AlgorithmSet}{@algorithm}) OPTIONAL
     }
~~~

<aside markdown="block">
NOTE: The above syntax is from {{!RFC5912}} and is compatible with
the 2021 ASN.1 syntax {{X680}}. See {{!RFC5280}} for the 1988 ASN.1
syntax.
</aside>

The fields in AlgorithmIdentifier have the following meanings:

* `algorithm` identifies the cryptographic algorithm with an object
identifier (OID).

* `parameters`, which are optional, are the associated parameters for the
algorithm identifier in the algorithm field.

The NIST-registered OIDs {{CSOR}} are:

<aside markdown="block">
NOTE: The OIDS, once registered by NIST, will be included below.
</aside>

~~~
id-fn-dsa-512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
            country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
            nistAlgorithm(4) sigAlgs(3) id-fn-dsa-512(TBD) }

id-fn-dsa-1024 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
            country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
            nistAlgorithm(4) sigAlgs(3) id-fn-dsa-1024(TBD) }
~~~

The contents of the `parameters` component for each `algorithm` MUST be
absent.

# FN-DSA Signatures in PKIX

FN-DSA is a lattice-based digital signature scheme based on the GPV
hash-and-sign framework {{GPV08}}, instantiated over NTRU (N-th Degree
Truncated Polynomial Ring Unit) lattices with Fast Fourier sampling
techniques {{DP16}}.  The security is based upon the hardness of the
underlying FN-DSA is the SIS (Short Integer Solution) problem over
NTRU lattices.  FN-DSA provides two parameter sets for the NIST PQC
security categories 512 and 1024.

Signatures are used in a number of different ASN.1 structures. As shown
in the ASN.1 equivalent to that in {{RFC5280}} below, in an X.509
certificate, a signature is encoded with an algorithm identifier in the
`signatureAlgorithm` attribute and a `signatureValue` attribute that
contains the actual signature.

~~~
  Certificate  ::=  SIGNED{ TBSCertificate }

  SIGNED{ToBeSigned} ::= SEQUENCE {
     toBeSigned           ToBeSigned,
     algorithmIdentifier  SEQUENCE {
         algorithm        SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM.
                            &id({SignatureAlgorithms}),
         parameters       SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM.
                            &Params({SignatureAlgorithms}
                              {@algorithmIdentifier.algorithm})
                                OPTIONAL
     },
     signature BIT STRING (CONTAINING SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM.&Value(
                              {SignatureAlgorithms}
                              {@algorithmIdentifier.algorithm}))
  }
~~~

Signatures are also used in the CRL list ASN.1, the representation
below is equivalent to that in {{RFC5280}}. In an X.509 CRL, a
signature is encoded with an algorithm identifier in the
`signatureAlgorithm` attribute and a `signatureValue` attribute
that contains the actual signature.

~~~
   CertificateList  ::=  SIGNED{ TBSCertList }
~~~

The following `SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM` ASN.1 classes are for FN-DSA-512
and FN-DSA-1024:

~~~
  sa-fn-dsa-512 SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM ::= {
    IDENTIFIER id-fn-dsa-512
    PARAMS ARE absent
    PUBLIC-KEYS { pk-fn-dsa-512 }
    SMIME-CAPS { IDENTIFIED BY id-fn-dsa-512 }
    }

  sa-fn-dsa-1024 SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM ::= {
    IDENTIFIER id-fn-dsa-1024
    PARAMS ARE absent
    PUBLIC-KEYS { pk-fn-dsa-1024 }
    SMIME-CAPS { IDENTIFIED BY id-fn-dsa-1024 }
    }
~~~

<aside markdown="block">
  NOTE: The above syntax is from {{RFC5912}} and is compatible with the
  2021 ASN.1 syntax {{X680}}.
</aside>

The identifiers defined in {{oids}} can be used as the
`AlgorithmIdentifier` in the `signatureAlgorithm` field in the sequence
`Certificate`/`CertificateList` and the `signature` field in the sequence
`TBSCertificate`/`TBSCertList` in certificates and CRLs, respectively,
{{RFC5280}}. The `parameters` of these signature algorithms MUST be
absent, as explained in {{oids}}. That is, the `AlgorithmIdentifier`
SHALL be a `SEQUENCE` of one component, the OID id-fn-dsa-*, where *
is 512 or 1024 -- see {{oids}}.

<aside markdown="block">
  TODO: Insert reference for context string (assuming there is one).
</aside>

The `signatureValue` field contains the corresponding FN-DSA signature
computed upon the ASN.1 DER-encoded `TBSCertificate`/`TBSCertList`
{{RFC5280}}.  The optional context string (ctx) parameter
as defined in Section X of {{FIPS206}} is left to its default value:
the empty string.

Conforming Certification Authority (CA) implementations MUST specify
the algorithms explicitly by using the OIDs specified in {{oids}} when
encoding FN-DSA signatures in certificates and CRLs. Conforming client
implementations that process certificates and CRLs using FN-DSA MUST
recognize the corresponding OIDs. Encoding rules for FN-DSA signature
values are specified in {{oids}}.

# FN-DSA Public Keys in PKIX {#FN-DSA-PublicKey}

In the X.509 certificate, the `subjectPublicKeyInfo` field has the
`SubjectPublicKeyInfo` type, which has the following ASN.1 syntax:

~~~
  SubjectPublicKeyInfo {PUBLIC-KEY: IOSet} ::= SEQUENCE {
      algorithm        AlgorithmIdentifier {PUBLIC-KEY, {IOSet}},
      subjectPublicKey BIT STRING
  }
~~~

<aside markdown="block">
  NOTE: The above syntax is from {{RFC5912}} and is compatible with the
  2021 ASN.1 syntax {{X680}}. See {{RFC5280}} for the 1988 ASN.1 syntax.
</aside>

The fields in `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` have the following meaning:

* `algorithm` is the algorithm identifier and parameters for the
  public key (see above).

* `subjectPublicKey` contains the public key.

<aside markdown="block">
  TODO: Include reference to FIPS's section.
</aside>

Section XX of {{FIPS206}} defines the raw byte string
encoding of an FN-DSA public key. When used in a `SubjectPublicKeyInfo`
type, the `subjectPublicKey BIT STRING` contains this raw byte string
encoding of the public key. When an FN-DSA public key appears outside
of a `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` type in an environment that uses ASN.1
encoding, it could be encoded as an `OCTET STRING` by using the
`FN-DSA-512-PublicKey` and `FN-DSA-1024-PublicKey` types corresponding
to the correct key size defined below.

The `PUBLIC-KEY` ASN.1 types for FN-DSA are defined here:

<aside markdown="block">
  TODO: Include key sizes below.
</aside>

~~~
  pk-fn-dsa-512 PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
    IDENTIFIER id-fn-dsa-512
    -- KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
    CERT-KEY-USAGE
      { digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyCertSign, cRLSign }
    -- PRIVATE-KEY no ASN.1 wrapping; YYYY octets --
  }

  pk-fn-dsa-87 PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
    IDENTIFIER id-fn-dsa-1024
    -- KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
    CERT-KEY-USAGE
      { digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyCertSign, cRLSign }
    -- PRIVATE-KEY no ASN.1 wrapping; YYYY octets --
  }

  FN-DSA-512-PublicKey ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (897))

  FN-DSA-1024-PublicKey ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (1793))

  FN-DSA-PrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (32))
~~~

<aside markdown="block">
  NOTE: The above syntax is from {{RFC5912}} and is compatible with the
  2021 ASN.1 syntax {{X680}}.
</aside>

{{?RFC5958}} specifies the Asymmetric Key Package's `OneAsymmetricKey`
type for encoding asymmetric keypairs. When an FN-DSA private key or
keypair is encoded as a `OneAsymmetricKey`, it follows the description
in {{priv-key}}.

When the FN-DSA private key appears outside of an Asymmetric Key Package
in an environment that uses ASN.1 encoding, it can be encoded using
`FN-DSA-PrivateKey`.

{{examples}} contains example FN-DSA public keys encoded using the
textual encoding defined in {{?RFC7468}}.

# Key Usage Bits

The intended application for the key is indicated in the `keyUsage`
certificate extension; see {{Section 4.2.1.3 of RFC5280}}. If the
`keyUsage` extension is present in a certificate that includes `id-fn-dsa-*`
(where * is 512 or 1024 -- see {{oids}}) in the `SubjectPublicKeyInfo`,
then the subject public key can only be used for verifying digital
signatures on certificates or CRLs, or those used in an entity authentication
service, a data origin authentication service, an integrity service, and/or
a non-repudiation service that protects against the signing entity falsely
denying some action. This means that the `keyUsage` extension MUST have at
least one of the following bits set:

* `digitalSignature`
* `nonRepudiation`
* `keyCertSign`
* `cRLSign`

FN-DSA subject public keys cannot be used to establish keys or encrypt data, so the
`keyUsage` extension MUST NOT have any of following bits set:

* `keyEncipherment`
* `dataEncipherment`
* `keyAgreement`
* `encipherOnly`
* `decipherOnly`

Requirements about the `keyUsage` extension bits defined in {{RFC5280}}
still apply.

#  Private Key Format {#priv-key}

<aside markdown="block">
  NOTE: Hope the following is true!
</aside>

{{FIPS206}} specifies an FN-DSA private key as a 32-octet seed (`&xi;`).

"Asymmetric Key Packages" {{!RFC5958}} specifies how to encode a private
key in a structure that both identifies what algorithm the private key
is for and allows for the public key and additional attributes about the
key to be included as well. For illustration, the ASN.1 structure
`OneAsymmetricKey` is replicated below.

~~~
  OneAsymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE {
    version                  Version,
    privateKeyAlgorithm      SEQUENCE {
    algorithm                PUBLIC-KEY.&id({PublicKeySet}),
    parameters               PUBLIC-KEY.&Params({PublicKeySet}
                               {@privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm})
                                  OPTIONAL}
    privateKey               OCTET STRING (CONTAINING
                               PUBLIC-KEY.&PrivateKey({PublicKeySet}
                                 {@privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm})),
    attributes           [0] Attributes OPTIONAL,
    ...,
    [[2: publicKey       [1] BIT STRING (CONTAINING
                               PUBLIC-KEY.&Params({PublicKeySet}
                                 {@privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm})
                                 OPTIONAL ]],
    ...
  }
~~~

<aside markdown="block">
  NOTE: The above syntax is from {{RFC5958}} and is compatible with the
  2021 ASN.1 syntax {{X680}}.
</aside>

For FN-DSA private keys, the `privateKey` field in `OneAsymmetricKey`
contains raw octet string encoding of the 32-octet seed.

{{examples}} contains example FN-DSA private keys encoded using the
textual encoding defined in {{RFC7468}}.

# IANA Considerations

the following object identifier (OID) in the "SMI Security for PKIX
Module Identifier" registry (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.0):

# Operational Considerations {#opcons}

## Rationale for Disallowing HashFN-DSA {#sec-disallow-hash}

<aside markdown="block">
  TODO: Get section reference for HashFN-DSA.
</aside>

The HashFN-DSA mode defined in Section X.X of {{FIPS206}} MUST NOT be
used; in other words, public keys identified by
`id-hash-fn-dsa-512-with-sha512` and `id-hash-fn-dsa-1024-with-sha512`
MUST NOT be in X.509 certificates used for
CRLs, OCSP, certificate issuance, and related PKIX protocols. This
restriction is primarily to increase interoperability.

FN-DSA and HashFN-DSA are incompatible algorithms that require
different `Verify()` routines. This introduces the complexity of
informing the verifier whether to use `FN-DSA.Verify()` or
`HashFN-DSA.Verify()`. Additionally, since
the same OIDs are used to identify the FN-DSA
public keys and FN-DSA signature algorithms, an implementation would
need to commit a given public key to be either of type `FN-DSA` or
`HashFN-DSA` at the time of certificate creation. This is anticipated
to cause operational issues in contexts where the operator does not
know whether the key will need to produce pure or pre-hashed signatures
at key-generation time.

# Security Considerations

<aside markdown="block">
  TODO: Most copied from RFC 9881. Dropped the bit about Gaussian sampling.
  Also, FN-DSA is only going to support randomized sigs, I figured we
  could use the text about why they didn't pick deterministic to
  introduce floating-point issues.
</aside>

The Security Considerations section of {{RFC5280}} applies to this
specification as well.

<aside markdown="block">
  TODO: Verify EUF-CMA. Get #s for chosen messages
</aside>

The FN-DSA signature scheme is unforgeable under chosen message
attacks (EUF-CMA). For the purpose of estimating security strength, it has
been assumed that the attacker has access to signatures for no more
than 2^{XX} chosen messages.

<aside markdown="block">
  TODO: Get section reference.
</aside>

FN-DSA depends on high quality random numbers that are suitable for
use in cryptography.  The use of inadequate pseudo-random number
generators (PRNGs) to generate such values can significantly undermine
various security properties. For instance, using an inadequate PRNG
for key generation, might allow an attacker to efficiently recover
the private key by trying a small set of possibilities, rather than
brute force search the whole keyspace.  The generation of random
numbers of a sufficient level of quality for use in cryptography
is difficult; see Section X.X.X of {{FIPS206}} for some additional
information.

In the design of FN-DSA, care has been taken to make side-channel
resilience easier to achieve. Implementations must still take great care
not to leak information via various side channels. While deliberate
design decisions such as these can help to deliver a greater ease
of secure implementation - particularly against side-channel
attacks - it does not necessarily provide resistance to more
powerful attacks such as differential power analysis. Some amount
of side-channel leakage has been demonstrated in parts of the
signing algorithm (specifically the bit-unpacking function), from
which a demonstration of key recovery has been made over a large
sample of signatures. Masking countermeasures exist for
FN-DSA, but come with a performance overhead.

<aside markdown="block">
  TODO: Expand the following to also talk about floating point
  implementation challenges.
</aside>

FN-DSA only offers randomized signing. Deterministic signing could
be dangerous as mistakes in floating-point implementation could cause
different signatures for same hash.

<aside markdown="block">
  TODO: Get reference.
</aside>

A security property also associated with digital
signatures is non-repudiation. Non-repudiation refers to the
assurance that the owner of a signature key pair that was
capable of generating an existing signature corresponding to
certain data cannot convincingly deny having signed the data,
unless its private key was compromised.
The digital signature scheme FN-DSA possess three security
properties beyond unforgeability, that are associated with
non-repudiation. These are exclusive ownership, message-bound
signatures, and non-resignability. These properties are based
tightly on the assumed collision resistance of the hash
function used (in this case SHAKE-256). A full discussion
of these properties in FN-DSA can be found at XXXX.

## Example Private Keys {#example-private}

The following examples show FN-DSA private keys in different formats,
all derived from the same seed `000102...1e1f`. For each security level,
we show the seed-only format (using a context-specific `[0]` primitive
tag with an implicit encoding of `OCTET STRING`), the `expanded` format,
and `both` formats together.

NOTE: All examples use the same seed value, showing how the same seed
produces different expanded private keys for each security level.
